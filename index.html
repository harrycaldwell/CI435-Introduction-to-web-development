							<p>Week 1 is the beginning of the module CI435, This module is to introduce students to web
								development and to create skills needed to program in HTML and CSS, and at some point
								Javascript will be introduced, in the first week we gained access to the web server and
								created the basic file system for storing Cascading style sheets(CSS) and assets such
								as images. In this week we started to set up our site and domain, we did this by:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Logging into brighton domain</li>
								<li>Navigating to the file manager</li>
								<li>Creating the file directory in the Public Html folder</li>
								<li>Once This was done we would create three HTML files these would be the Index page,
									Contact Me page and the Learning journal page.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>After creating the directories, the file system looked like this:</p>

							<p>To help with producing the skills needed, we are using MDN web docs which has tutorials
								and key recourses needed to produce the skills needed to create the website with correct
								syntax that site can be found here

							<p>In this week, I learnt about the <code>time</code> tag, this allowed me to create
								ISO-8601 format dates for when these journal articles are published, to give importance
								to the date I also used the strong tag to make the date bold to make it draw readers
								attention so that they could better see the learning progression. Further more in the
								Lab I learnt about creating Lists using the <code>li</code>, <code>ul</code>,
								<code>ol</code> tags that stand for: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>list items(li)</li>
								<li>Unordered list(ul)</li>
								<li>Ordered list(ol)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The list items tag use is to be done when nested within the unordered or ordered list
								tags to show this I will take an example from this very page to show how it is
								implemented into the code</p>

								<u>Week 3</u>

							<p>Published on <time datetime="2022-10-21">
									<strong>October 21, 2022</strong>
								</time>
							</p>
							<p>In this week we looked at another form of list, this is called a description list and
								this is used to add a glossary of definitions or descriptions of items, to do this we
								start of using the tag <code>dl</code> and that will be the tag that we use to start
								nesting the other tags those being: </p>
							<dl>
								<dt>
									<strong>
										<code>dt</code>
									</strong>
								</dt>
								<dd>This is what defines a term or the name of something in a description list or
									<code>dl</code>
								</dd>
								<dt>
									<strong>
										<code>dd</code>
									</strong>
								</dt>
								<dd>The dd tag is used with the <code>dl</code>and <code>dt</code>this is used to give
									descriptions of the items in the description list. </dd>
							</dl>
							<p>To show how the tags are used I will take a screenshot of the code that was used to make
								the description list above so that an example is here to be seen</p>
							<figure>
								<img alt="" src="images/screenshot_2_list_code.png"

							<p>In addition to this we also looked at creating a table on the webpage, as an example for
								this site I am going to use my Timetable to show how they can be used in the website.

							<!--Start of table used to create my Uni timetable as an example-->

							<p>In addition to this I also learnt about citing sources in HTML using the
								<code>blockquote</code>, <code>cite</code>tags, these allow us to cite sources correctly
								however if you read from this quote below:</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>It's worth noting that the W3C specification says that a reference to a creative
									work, as included within a <code>cite</code> element, may include the name of the
									work's author. However, the WHATWG specification for <code>cite</code> says the
									opposite: that a person's name must never be included, under any circumstances.</p>
								<cite>
									<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite">MDN Web
										Docs</a>
								</cite>
							</blockquote>
							<p>In the two different specifications W3C and WHATWG they oppose each other saying that
								authors names should be included in citations in W3C but in WHATWG they say they must
								never be included, for the sake of references on this webpage authors names will be
								included where possible if unavailable a link will be provided to where the information
								was acquired </p>

							</p>
							<p>This week in Lectures and Labs we looked at creating the CSS (stylesheet) for the site,
								this is used to give the website actual structure, we do this by using the language CSS
								which is a declarative language where we call on things such as:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Class IDs that we have layed out in the HTML code.</li>
								<li>Div tags that we have used to divide the HTML pages into sections so that we can
									later style them individually.</li>
								<li>Tags that are used in the code for example <code>h1</code>.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Why do we do this? Well to make the website look pretty, without CSS the site will remain
								unformatted and there will be no structure to the site at all, so by using CSS we are
								able to control the structure of the page, in addition to structure it also allows us to
								customize the site with different fonts of our choice be it a serif or sans serif style
								font even fonts that are not native to PCs and Mobile devices, we can change the color
								of backgrounds and control things like where things such as text are placed on the site.

								</time>
							</p>
							<p>In this week of labs, we looked at starting to create the page for tutorials, and how to specify font families and a fall back for if the font cannot be displayed correctly, this is done in css by doing the following example:<br>
								<code>
									body{<br>
										font-family: georgia, "times new roman", Times, serif;<br>
									}<br>
								</code>
							<p>To ensure that text can be correctly displayed on all devices that are able to connect to the website, you should always include system default fonts so that in the event that the font is unable to be retreived from the webserver or fonts source we are still able to display content that should be on the page
