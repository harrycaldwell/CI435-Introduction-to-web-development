						<h2>Welcome to my Tutorial page</h2>
						<p>On this page I will talk about the skills that I have developed this semester, specifically
							group working.</p>

						<h3>What is Group working?</h3>

						<p>"Group work refers to a collaborative learning environment where students work through
							problems and assessments together. Students are able to delegate roles and responsibilities,
							pool their knowledge and skills and receive support from one another." - <a
								href="https://tophat.com/glossary/g/group-work/">Tophat definition </a></p>

						<h3>What have I learnt?</h3>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Perspective helps</strong> - I found that while studying with someone else I am
								able to have more than one view on a subject allowing me to consider more options and
								solutions to a problem.</li>
							
							<li><strong>Encouragement</strong> - Encouragement of peers and being Encouraged by peers
								should be used to push each other further to the goal that has been set.</li>
							
							<li><strong>Setting Goals</strong> - Setting goals when working as a group helps create a
								sense of progress. This increases the motivation of the group and also provides a
								framework for what should be done.</li>
							
							<li><strong>Problem Solving</strong> - Working in pairs allowed for the opportunity to work
								on my problem solving skills by listening to the Perspective of the person I was working
								with and being able to throw ideas at each other.</li>
						</ol>

						<h3>How affected me?</h3>
						<p>As of current I have not had any group working assigned to me, however
							this has not stopped the development of this skill as I have been able to work with my
							classmate, which helped me develop this website.</p>

						<p>Before starting the semester studying was a difficult task, not for a lack of trying, I found
							that without being in group studies it was harder for me to focus and would require way more
							time then what I had. Studying in a group has allowed me to gain motivation and in fact
							allowed me to motivate the person I have been studying with, allowing us to push ourselves
							further and further.</p>

						<p>I found that by working in a group I was also working on my social skills,it helped me work
							on communication. </p>

						<p>Setting Goals has allowed me to take assignments step by step, and has allowed me to
							celebrate when completing parts of the assignment that I have set as a goal, it also has
							helped with my time management.</p>

						<p>Working in a pair has allowed me to work using constructive criticism from my "study buddy"
							allowing me to change and add to the website and other work that I have been assigned.</p>

						<h3>Skill learning resources</h3>
						<p>My main resource for learning and reinforcing group working as a skill was the Brighton
							Student Skills Hub which has a skill guide called "Effective Group Work Strategies". In
							addition to this I also used the video below:<br></p>
